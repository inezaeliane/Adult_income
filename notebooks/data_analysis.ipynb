    "# UCI Adult Income Dataset - Exploratory and Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we carry out an in-depth exploratory and descriptive analysis of the UCI Adult Income Dataset, a widely used dataset for income prediction tasks based on individual demographic and employment attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase of analysis is essential for uncovering patterns, detecting potential biases, and gaining intuition about the dataset’s structure before applying any modelling procedures. We examine the distribution of key numerical and categorical variables, investigate relationships between demographic features and income levels, and use visualizations to summarize insights. Particular focus is placed on income disparities across **age groups**, **geographical regions**, **races**, and **education-occupation combinations**, helping lay a solid foundation for downstream modeling and policy-relevant interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin our analysis by importing the core Python libraries required for **data handling**, **numerical computation**, **visualization**, and **directory management**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas`: Enables efficient manipulation, filtering, and aggregation of structured tabular data, forming the backbone of our analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy`: Provides support for fast numerical operations, array-based computation, and statistical routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `os`: Facilitates interaction with the file system, allowing us to construct flexible and portable directory paths for data and output management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `plotly.express`: A high-level graphing library that enables the creation of interactive, publication-quality visualizations, which we use extensively to uncover patterns and present insights throughout the notebook.\n"

    "This summary provides a snapshot of key distribution characteristics. We see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age ranges from 17 to 90, with a mean of 38.6 years. It is slightly right-skewed (positively skewed). While the average age is approximately 38.6 years, an examination of the percentiles reveals that the majority of individuals are clustered in the younger to middle-age range, with fewer observations in the older age brackets. This skewed age distribution might suggest labor force participation is concentrated in specific age groups, which could reflect broader demographic or economic realities.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Capital gains/losses are highly skewed, with most values at 0 (the 75th percentile is 0). This indicates that a small number of individuals report very large gains or losses, especially evident in the capital gain variable which reaches up to $99,999. These variables act as proxies for wealth-related income that goes beyond regular wages or salaries. Individuals with non-zero values for capital gains or losses often represent a distinct socioeconomic subset of the population — typically more financially literate, or with access to investment assets. The stark inequality in their distributions mirrors real-world disparities in asset ownership and investment returns.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The dataset has individuals working anywhere from 1 to 99 hours per week, with a median of 40. This aligns with the standard full-time work week in many countries (8 hours per day for 5 working days). The mean is slightly above that at 40.4 hours, suggesting a mild right skew, with a small subset of individuals working significantly longer hours. The mode is also 40, further reinforcing the prevalence of full-time work. A non-trivial number of individuals report working very few hours, possibly due to part-time work, unemployment, or semi-retirement. On the other extreme, some report working more than 45 hours per week, which may indicate multiple jobs, weekend-work, self-employment, or informal labor, and could reflect socioeconomic necessity.\n",

    "The private sector dominates, employing ~69.7% of the population. The government sector (13.4%) and self-employment (11.2%) also make up substantial portions of the workforce. A small fraction is labeled as \"unknown\" (5.6%), which may correspond to missing or ambiguous data entries. Tiny proportions are voluntary (0.04%) or unemployed (0.02%), possibly underreported or underrepresented in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "`marital_status`\n",
    "\n",
    "Married individuals make up the largest group (46.1%), followed by those who are single (32.8%) and divorced or separated (18.1%). Widowed individuals represent a small minority (~3.1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "`relationship`\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority are labeled as \"male spouse\" (40.5%) or \"single\" (36.1%). Smaller categories include children (15.6%), female spouses (4.8%), and extended relatives (3.0%). The dominance of `male spouse` reflects the dataset’s gendered structure and may point to traditional family roles. The relative scarcity of \"female spouse\" roles suggests potential gender imbalances in how income-earning is reported within households.\n",
    "\n",
    "`race`\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is overwhelmingly composed of White individuals (~85.4%). Other racial groups include Black (9.6%), Asian or Pacific Islander (3.2%), American Indian or Eskimo (1.0%), and Other (0.8%). The racial imbalance limits the generalizability of models trained on this data. Smaller racial groups may suffer from limited statistical power, affecting fairness and performance in predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sex`\n",
    "\n",
    "Males constitute 66.9% of the dataset, with females making up the remaining 33.1%. This male-skewed distribution could be due to sampling (e.g., primary earners in households), workforce participation patterns, or reporting biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`education_level`\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary-school graduates form the largest educational group (~32%), highlighting the central role of high school completion in the labor force. Tertiary education holders — those with university or equivalent degrees — account for nearly 25% of the population, representing a substantial segment with advanced qualifications. A notable 22.4% have attended some college without necessarily earning a degree, suggesting that partial post-secondary education is common, yet may not always translate into formal certification. The remaining 20% are distributed among those with only secondary education (9.4%), associate degrees (7.5%), primary school (3.5%), and a very small group with only preschool education (0.15%). It is ecident that the education distribution is skewed toward mid- to high-level education, with relatively few individuals having only basic schooling. This reflects a dataset that largely captures working-age adults in formal labor, which may underrepresent the least-educated populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`occupation_grouped`\n",
    "\n",
    "White-collar occupations are the most prevalent (~51%), followed by blue-collar, service, and unknown. Smaller categories include military, which is marginal. Essentially, slightly over half of individuals in the dataset work in professional, managerial, sales, clerical, or tech-support roles. This suggests the dataset is heavily weighted toward professional and administrative occupations. Nearly a third of the population works in manual labor or skilled trade positions (craft, transport, machine operation, farming, etc.). This indicates a significant segment engaged in physically intensive or technical labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "`native_region`\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of individuals are from North America (~92.3%). Smaller proportions are from Central America, Asia, Europe, South America, and a generic Other category. The heavy concentration of North American individuals reflects the U.S. focus of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "`age_group`\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest groups are 26–35 and 36–45, followed by 46–60. These three age groups represent about 73% of the dataset. Very few individuals are under 18 or above 75, consistent with the dataset's focus on the working-age population.\n"

    "The bar chart visualizes the income distribution across age groups, using percentages within each group. There is an evident pattern in terms of income progression over the years with a gradual increase in terms of the number of people earning >50K starting from 0 amongst those aged 18 and below, peaking between 36 and 60 years, then declining after 60 years but not to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "All individuals under 18 earn <=50K, likely due to being students, minors, or ineligible for full-time employment. Extremely few young adults (2.1%) exceed 50K, as most are early in their careers, pursuing education, or in entry-level jobs. For the 26-35 age group, there's a noticeable improvement — roughly 1 in 5 individuals in this group earn >50K, reflecting early career progression and accumulation of qualifications/experience. A substantial income increase is seen in the 36-45 age group: over a third now earn >50K. This is typically considered prime earning age where individuals settle into stable, higher-paying positions. Highest proportion of >50K earners is seen amongst individuals aged between 46 and 60— nearly 4 in 10. This reflects career maturity, peak seniority levels, and accumulated experience. There's a drop-off in high incomes as many transition to retirement, part-time, or less demanding roles in the age group 61-75. Yet about 1 in 4 still earn >50K. Most in 76+ age group earn <=50K, likely due to retirement, pensions, or fixed incomes — but a small minority still earn higher incomes, possibly through continued work or investments.\n"

    "Asia (30.7%) and Europe (29.2%) have the highest proportions of high-income earners. This suggests these immigrant groups might be better integrated into high-paying professional roles, or may represent a more skilled migrant profile in the dataset. Central America (11.1%) and South America (12.1%) have the lowest proportions of >50K earners. With 24.2% of North Americans earning >50K, this serves as a middle-ground baseline. Interestingly, both Asian and European groups outperform the native-born population proportionally in high-income brackets. The 'Other' group sits around 25.1%, close to North America’s rate.

On the other hand, American Indian or Eskimo (11.6%), Black (12.4%), and Other (9.2%) groups show significantly lower rates of high-income earners. These figures reflect long-standing economic disparities rooted in historical exclusion, occupational segregation, and systemic inequality.\n"
